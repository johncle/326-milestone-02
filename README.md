# Milestone 02 Idea Generation and Proposal Submission

**EXPERIMENTAL**

I am currently experimenting with a different way of distributing assignments and documentation. The documentation for this milestone is contained within this folder. To view the documentation, open a terminal in this folder and install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Now that the dependencies are installed, run the http server that will serve the documentation:

```bash
npm run docs
```

This will print some output including the URL that you need to visit to view the documentation. The default is [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Visit that link in your browser and read the documentation for this milestone.

Of course, you are also welcomed to read the markdown files directly in the `docs` folder.
